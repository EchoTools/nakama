# Demo: MatchDataJournal EventDispatcher Integration
# This script demonstrates the key functionality of the new event-driven architecture

echo "=== MatchDataJournal EventDispatcher Integration Demo ==="
echo

echo "1. Event-Driven Architecture:"
echo "   - MatchDataJournal is now a distinct event type in EventDispatcher"
echo "   - Events are processed asynchronously through event queue"
echo "   - Redis provides reliability buffer before MongoDB persistence"
echo

echo "2. Key Components:"
echo "   - EventMatchDataJournal: New event type for match data"
echo "   - Redis Queue: 'match_data_journal_queue' for reliability"
echo "   - MongoDB Collection: 'nevr.match_data' with optimized indexes"
echo

echo "3. Data Flow Example:"
echo "   Game Event → MatchDataEvent() → EventMatchDataJournal → Journal → Redis Queue → MongoDB"
echo

echo "4. Trigger Conditions:"
echo "   - Queue to Redis when journal has 100+ events"
echo "   - Queue to Redis when journal is 5+ minutes old"
echo "   - Fallback to direct MongoDB if Redis unavailable"
echo

echo "5. Remote Log Integration:"
echo "   - Remote logs with valid session IDs automatically captured"
echo "   - Converted to MatchDataRemoteLogSet and sent through same pipeline"
echo

echo "6. MongoDB Indexes Created:"
echo "   - match_id_1: Primary index for match queries"
echo "   - match_id_created_at_-1: Compound index for temporal queries"
echo "   - updated_at_-1: Index for cleanup operations"
echo "   - created_at_ttl: TTL index for automatic cleanup (30 days)"
echo

echo "7. Query Examples:"
echo "   # Find all data for a match"
echo "   db.match_data.find({\"match_id\": \"your-match-id\"})"
echo
echo "   # Find recent matches"
echo "   db.match_data.find({\"created_at\": {\"\$gte\": ISODate(\"2024-01-01\")}})"
echo

echo "8. Testing:"
echo "   ✓ EventMatchDataJournal creation and processing"
echo "   ✓ Journal entry management"
echo "   ✓ Event type validation"
echo

echo "9. Benefits:"
echo "   ✓ Better scalability through event-driven processing"
echo "   ✓ Improved reliability with Redis queue buffer"
echo "   ✓ Optimized MongoDB queries with proper indexing"
echo "   ✓ Automatic capture of remote logs with valid session IDs"
echo "   ✓ Backward compatibility maintained"
echo
