- when kicking a player, it only shows "Kicked from server" the player does not get an explanation
  - the player should be notified via DMs, and also have it available in /whoami.
  - add "kick only" enforcements to enforcement journal. (maybe add a new field to the enforcement entry.)
  - add kicks to enforcement log, but only show kicks in the past 3 days in /whoami.
  - show the past 3 days of kicks in /lookup, unless " unless the /lookup command is given "show_all_kicks"... otherwise just list a count of "unlisted kicks" in the embed.

- igp panel should specify that leaving the duration blank is a kick and will not add an suspension log entry.

- igp doesn't load in social lobbies sometimes
