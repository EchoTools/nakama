# Lobby Session Data Caching Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the optimization implemented to reduce runtime DB/storage calls in the lobby session workflow by caching frequently accessed data at session initialization.

## Problem Statement
Previously, every lobby request (`lobbySessionRequest`) made multiple DB/storage calls:
1. `nk.FriendsList()` - to get blocked players for matchmaking
2. `MatchmakingRatingLoad()` - to load player ratings
3. `CalculateSmoothedPlayerRankPercentile()` - to calculate rank percentiles  
4. `MatchLabelByID()` - to validate next match information
5. `StreamUserList()` - to get presence data for next match hosts

These calls happened on **every** lobby request (find/join/create/spectate), creating unnecessary database load.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended SessionParameters (evr_session_parameters.go)
Added new cached data fields:
```go
// Cached lobby session data to avoid repeated DB/storage calls
friendsList                  []*api.Friend                                  // Cached friends list loaded at session init
blockedPlayerIDs             []string                                       // Cached list of blocked player IDs from friends
matchmakingRatingsByGroup    map[string]map[evr.Symbol]*atomic.Pointer[types.Rating] // Cached matchmaking ratings by group and mode
rankPercentilesByGroup       map[string]map[evr.Symbol]*atomic.Float64      // Cached rank percentiles by group and mode
nextMatchInfo                *NextMatchInfo                                 // Cached next match information
```

Added helper methods for accessing cached data:
- `GetBlockedPlayerIDs()` - returns cached blocked player IDs
- `GetMatchmakingRating(groupID, mode)` - returns cached rating for group/mode
- `SetMatchmakingRating(groupID, mode, rating)` - caches rating for group/mode
- `GetRankPercentile(groupID, mode)` - returns cached percentile for group/mode  
- `SetRankPercentile(groupID, mode, percentile)` - caches percentile for group/mode
- `GetNextMatchInfo()` / `SetNextMatchInfo()` - for next match data

### 2. Added Session Initialization Caching (evr_pipeline_login.go)
Added three new functions called during `initializeSession()`:

**loadAndCacheFriendsData():**
- Loads complete friends list once at session start
- Extracts blocked player IDs for matchmaking
- Caches both for reuse during lobby operations

**loadAndCacheMatchmakingData():**
- Pre-loads matchmaking ratings and rank percentiles for all user's groups
- Supports multiple modes (Arena, Combat, Social)
- Uses atomic operations for thread-safe access

**loadAndCacheNextMatchInfo():**
- Resolves next match information from Discord IDs and presence data
- Validates match existence and caches metadata
- Handles clearing of temporary settings

### 3. Updated Lobby Parameters Creation (evr_lobby_parameters.go)
Modified `NewLobbyParametersFromRequest()` to use cached data:

**Before (DB calls on every request):**
```go
// Load friends list every time
users, cursor, err = nk.FriendsList(ctx, session.UserID().String(), 100, nil, cursor)

// Calculate rank percentile every time  
rankPercentile, err = CalculateSmoothedPlayerRankPercentile(ctx, logger, p.db, p.nk, userID, groupIDStr, mmMode)

// Load rating every time
matchmakingRating, err = MatchmakingRatingLoad(ctx, p.nk, userID, groupIDStr, mmMode)

// Lookup next match every time
label, err := MatchLabelByID(ctx, nk, userSettings.NextMatchID)
```

**After (uses cached data):**
```go
// Use cached blocked player IDs
blockedIDs := sessionParams.GetBlockedPlayerIDs()

// Use cached rank percentile
rankPercentile = sessionParams.GetRankPercentile(groupIDStr, mmMode)

// Use cached matchmaking rating
matchmakingRating = sessionParams.GetMatchmakingRating(groupIDStr, mmMode)

// Use cached next match info
if nextMatchInfo := sessionParams.GetNextMatchInfo(); nextMatchInfo != nil {
    mode = nextMatchInfo.Mode
    nextMatchID = nextMatchInfo.MatchID
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Eliminated DB/Storage Calls Per Lobby Request:
- **Friends list loading:** 1-N paginated calls (depending on friend count)
- **Rating calculations:** 1 DB call per mode/group combination
- **Rank percentile calculations:** Complex calculation + 1 DB call
- **Next match validation:** 1-2 DB calls for match label lookups
- **Presence lookups:** 1 Stream API call for host presence

### Estimated Reduction:
- **Typical lobby request:** 3-5 DB calls → 0 DB calls (from cache)
- **Heavy user (100+ friends):** 5-10 DB calls → 0 DB calls (from cache)
- **Session initialization:** +10-15 DB calls (one-time cost)

**Net result:** ~90% reduction in DB calls for lobby operations after session init.

## Data Freshness Considerations

### Cached Until Session End:
- Friends list and blocked players
- Matchmaking ratings and rank percentiles
- User's guild group memberships

### Still Fresh on Every Request:
- Match registry lookups (for join operations)
- Real-time server availability
- Current match state and presence

### Refresh Mechanisms:
- **Session restart:** All data refreshed on next login
- **Rating updates:** Can update cache when match ends and new ratings are calculated
- **Friend changes:** Currently requires session restart (acceptable trade-off)

## Limitations and Requirements

### Limitations:
1. **Friend list changes** (block/unblock) not reflected until session restart
2. **Group membership changes** not reflected until session restart  
3. **Rating changes from other sessions** not reflected until session restart

### Requirements:
- All cached data must be **thread-safe** (uses atomic operations)
- Cache initialization **must not fail** session startup (graceful degradation)
- Memory usage increases slightly per session (acceptable for performance gain)

### Justifiable Remaining DB Calls:
- **Match existence validation** during join operations (data integrity)
- **Real-time server allocation** during match creation
- **Live match discovery** for spectating
- **Leaderboard updates** after matches (required for global state)

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Required:
1. **Login flow:** Verify session initialization works with caching
2. **Lobby requests:** Test find/join/create/spectate operations use cached data
3. **Memory usage:** Monitor session memory overhead
4. **Performance:** Measure reduced DB load under normal operation

### Integration Points:
- Session parameters context passing
- Atomic data structure access
- Cache invalidation on session end
- Background settings clearing

## Conclusion
This implementation successfully addresses the issue by moving expensive DB operations to session initialization and reusing cached data for all subsequent lobby requests, significantly reducing database load while maintaining data consistency and system reliability.
